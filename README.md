# Coding_Journey_Notes

Learning commands in Terminal and how to write a Git Gist. 

I have also begun to learn the fundamentals of HTML.

I find both backend and frondt end coding very interesting and I love how it all comes togeher in the end. 

Coding has been a fun journey so far. 

## Issues to remember

I learned that changing the name of your computer can cause a lot of issues if you have already set up the environment prior to the change.

Had to reinstall Ruby and Node. Everything else was working ok. Still having issues with homebrew but its not an issue I can't work around.
